Freshly after Twine's closure and with many lessons learned from my first startup endeavor, I was poised to tackle a problem that's been itching at the back of my mind for longer than mutual friendships: discovering street food in New York City. The journey from inception to full-blown product was a long and arduous one, but with it came lifelong lessons I'll never forget.

This article is not a tale of this journey, but a catalog of wins and losses faced by myself and the team over the course of our year at Crave Street.
