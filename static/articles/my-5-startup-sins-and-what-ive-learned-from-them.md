Everyone has an idea, fewer people act on that idea, but only the perceptive and determined make something out of it.

When I was pitched the idea for [Twine](http://www.twineme.com/) my freshman year of college, my naïveté for the complexity of the startup world was suppressed by my sheer ambition to create the next best app, and through stubbornness, unawareness, and circumstances out of our (Twine team’s) control was a product that died a slow, premature death. Could it have been avoided? Most certainly, but what came out of it were lessons I am forever grateful for learning, and thus I wrote this article to share these few lessons with you. So, here it goes…

My friend Kavi and another partner at the time (who eventually left the team) pitched to me an idea for a dating app where people could “twine,” or connect, two of their friends like a matchmaker, and then initiate their conversation. Not knowing a thing or two about building mobile apps or managing a product, I obliviously counted myself in.

In a matter of meetings, our inexperience led us to design a prototype that ignored bare UX fundamentals, and within our first meeting, we had already committed the first instance of **Startup Sin #1: Neglecting to Create a User-Driven Product**. My partner and I understood the product's vision from the beginning, and this was our strongest asset. However, we consistently failed to ask real-world users about Twine's features and our proposals for the app, in fear of losing our idea to others or having our vision for the product contested. Truth is, it was more likely that we were to be bought out by Amazon in the pre-beta phase than to have our idea stolen, and it was largely our rigidness in vision that led to Twine's downward spiral.

Kavi and I harmoniously shared Twine's vision, but issues arose since he had minimum prior marketing experience and no exposure to startup and product management, just as I had. Hence, I coerced myself into juggling both development and management of the company throughout its life span. To expedite development later on, I pushed management to the side until it was no longer either of our responsibilities. We had no roadmap, and hence committed **Startup Sin #2: Not Having a Plan**. Working nonstop, the startup soon became a race between time and the rate at which I could deploy an established Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

We hit many brick walls, but the most notable one came from the residue left by our second startup sin. Months into development, we committed **Startup Sin #3: Not Defining the MVP**, as we failed to set the bounds for what we deemed to be Twine's MVP. In his ideal for the [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/), Eric Ries claims the first iteration (and every iteration henceforth) of such a product must be able to test a product hypothesis with the minimum amount of company resources. On the other hand, I didn't even know when to stop adding features to the product until my partner and I agreed to just put a halt on development and host two closed beta testing sessions. If we'd launched earlier, we could have gained enough user input to make more validated decisions before spending so much time polishing unvalidated features.

The beta sessions happened two months after the general timeframe we'd aimed for due to software roadblocks stemming from the technology we'd chosen to use early on. Kavi and I thus committed **Startup Sin #4: Choosing the Wrong Technology**, because [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) simply was not ready to handle and scale a social media application as it was, and our biggest regret was not coding a native iOS application in Swift given we'd chosen to launch the beta version for iOS only.

Last but not least, we wound up committing **Startup Sin #5: Losing Faith in the Product**. After our beta testing sessions, Kavi and I were uncomfortable with the comments by the testers, which had neutral questions and comments but an obvious connotation that they simply did not enjoy using the app. More than that, Kavi resigned from Twine work shortly after, and I was left with an app that was so slow and buggy, I stopped showing the MVP to others in fear of them slashing my own abilities as a developer. Since then, I learned that this was the severest sin of all. There was a time when we pitched the idea at my university's pitch competition, and we had students fawning over how much they wanted to use our product. We'd attracted a small group of initial users that made comments beneficial to the product, but we ignored these comments on the basis that they interfered with our own vision.

At the end of the day, I'd created an app that did everything we envisioned, but I simply could not muster using any more resources on an app I was not proud of... *but, perhaps I should've*.

Despite never launching, Twine was still a learning experience that led me into the risky and uncertain world of startups, and though there may have been many more startup sins we've committed, these are only the ones I could recount off the top of my head. That being said, the world of startups is just as rewarding as it is unforgiving.
